# Interactive-Python

The intent of this repository is my own practice using GitHub by posting code from my original course work.

You may run this code using the on-line development environment http://www.codeskulptor.org/

Feel free to use this code for your own learning if you get stuck on a project but please do not use it to cheat. 

After all what would be the point of a simple copy / paste?

What would you learn?
